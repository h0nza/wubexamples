Introduction:
=============

This is a set of examples using the Wub webserver. You can find Wub at Google
Code:

    http://code.google.com/p/wub/

These examples use the SVN Head version.

Requirements to run the examples:
=================================

- Install wub, or a link to it, in this directory in a sub-directory called 'Wub'.

- Install tcllib, or a link to it, in this directory in a subdirectory called
  'tcllib'.

Example 1: A file domain
==========

This example show how to configure Wub to let it serve static files from the
file system path docroot/html with URL /

Example 2: A file domain with rewrites and browsing
==========

This example shows how Wub can be used to browse the file system. Try using URL
/disk.

Files in docroot/html are now mounted on URL /html. A rewrite allows them to be
accessed from /.
